# Recon Automation Scripts 🚀  
**Developer:** Khushi Mistry  
**Focus:** Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (Recon Phase)

This project automates reconnaissance for web security testing using Bash.  
It chains multiple open-source tools to discover subdomains, endpoints, and parameters,  
then quickly checks for potential XSS, SQLi, 403 bypass, and takeover vulnerabilities.


Automates recon & vulnerability discovery with:
- Subdomain enumeration (amass, subfinder, findomain)
- Live host check (httpx)
- Endpoint + parameter extraction (katana, paramspider)
- Quick vulnerability scans (dalfox, sqlmap)
- Clean reports (`final_vuln.txt`) for each target

> ⚠️ For educational and authorized security testing only. Never use against systems without explicit permission.
Bash-based recon automation for VAPT: subdomain discovery, endpoint extraction, takeover checks and quick XSS/SQLi scans. Use only on authorized targets.
